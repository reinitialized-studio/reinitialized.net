# What is this project?
This project contains all necessary resources to deploy the reinitialized.net infrastructure under as few commands as possible

# What is reinitialized.net?
reinitialized.net is the backend empowering Reinitialized Studio and its associated projects. It is designed to run on infrastructure under private control, and not a public cloud provider.

# What does this project manage?
As much as it can:
- [managing bare metal](https://maas.io)
- [managing vSphere and deploying virtual machines](https://terraform.io)
- [configuring bare metal and virtual machines](https://ansible.io)

# Why is the license so restrictive?
It's temporary. While I organize how I want to accomplish things, I don't want any unauthorized use or changes of my works to be made. Once I am comfortable with the state of things, I'll move to a less restrictive or FOSS license.
